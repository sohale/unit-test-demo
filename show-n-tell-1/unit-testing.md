# Unit Testing: How & Why

## Why (motivation)
Managing complexity
Why it works? / why this way? Seems magical.
* Curse of dimensionality

## How (with live coding): technical
## History & Context

QA (Quality, QA teams, pre-2000)

* Kent Beck (and consequences)
* Refactoring
* DORA study

More objective assessment: DORA

Where to look:
* The XP book
* The Tidy First
* (The DORA report)
* The book "Accelerate"

## Best practices (how)
* The person who wrote the code should write it
* As early as possible
* Even before the code
* Unseparable part of writing the code
* Refactoring

### Why?
Almost magic: Less cost, faster, ...
IKEA example:
Know earlier
Detachable parts
Offloading from QA

## My observations
in my career
### My observations in past companies
* Helping avoid crashing
* Helping in costs
* Scaling up better practices in software, team work
### Discussions
* Spoken to people I know. Checked with people.
* Videos by
   * Dave Farley (videos and book)
   * Kent Beck
   * Lots of good videos about Unit Tests
   and bad ones
* Assessment

### Suggestions:
* Separate QA for "software"
* Technical debt
* Coverage report
* Transition phase
